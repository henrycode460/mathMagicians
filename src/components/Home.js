        <p className="homeText"> Mathemagician is a neologism, specifically a portmanteau, that combines mathematician and magician. A great number of self-working mentalism tricks rely on mathematical principles. Max Maven often utilizes this type of magic in his performance.  </p>
        <p className="homeTextTwo"> Mathematics is all around us as well as in our past and in our future.  Nature and science is inherently mathematical for instance the spiral pattern of a sea shell can be infinitely extended in both directions.   Examples of symmetry, sets, fractals are all around us.  Even everyday “objects” – music, art, industrial design, the rhythm of breathing, the interchanging relationship between matter and energy can all be understood mathematically.   It seems as if there were no mathematics, there would be no universe.  Or is it the other way round!  Some would argue, that mathematics is the language or word from which the Universe and Time itself was fashioned, with zero being that which is non-existent and everything up to one, being the infinity of existence.Math Magic is a celebration of mathematics.  Students will delve into the world of numbers, equations, curves, sets, fractals, geometry etc.  As they explore, they will start to recognize the mathematical underpinnings in the world around us whist at the same time losing their fear of numbers, gaining mental acuity and improving their maths performace in schools. </p>
